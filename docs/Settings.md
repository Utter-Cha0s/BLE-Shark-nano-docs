Extra Settings Mode allows you to configure every feature, upload custom files, and tweak the BLEShark Nano's behavior right from your browser.

  <li>Tap <strong>Login</strong> - the full settings dashboard will open in your browser.</li>
</ul>

### Navigating the Settings Portal

Once you're logged in, you’ll see a categorized menu of options. Each section is labeled by function, and expanding one will reveal more specific settings or tools.

Here’s how the layout works:

- Select a category like <strong>Apps</strong>, <strong>Wi-Fi Tools</strong>, or <strong>Display Settings</strong>.
- A dropdown will appear with related options. For example:
  - In <strong>Apps</strong>, you’ll find tools like <em>Upload TxtViewer File</em>.
  - In <strong>Pentesting</strong>, you might see options to configure deauth behavior or upload captive portal code.
- Make your changes or upload your file as needed.

:::warning[Saving Changes]
Always press the <strong>Apply Settings</strong> button when you're finished.  
If you don’t, your updates won’t be saved and the BLEShark Nano will keep the old settings.
