Your BLEShark Nano includes built-in games for quick, casual fun - great for passing time!

### Games on the BLEShark Nano

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="flappy" label="Flappy Bird">
Tap <strong>[S]</strong> to flap. Avoid pipes and don't crash! It starts easy, then ramps up fast. Great for testing reflexes or killing five minutes.
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="invaders" label="Invaders">
Use <strong>[L]</strong> and <strong>[R]</strong> to move and shoot. Clear waves of aliens before they reach you. Gets faster the longer you survive.
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="pong" label="Pong w/AI">
Classic paddle vs AI. Just keep the ball in play. Great for zoning out or proving you still have fast thumbs.
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="breakout" label="Breakout">
Break bricks with a bouncing ball. Move with <strong>[L]</strong> and <strong>[R]</strong>. Don’t miss, or you lose a life.
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="trex" label="T-Rex Runner">
Jump over cacti and stay alive as the game speeds up. It's the Chrome offline game, but now it's portable.
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="racing" label="Racing">
React fast and dodge obstacles. No brakes, no mercy. **Use [R] to accelerate & [L] and [S] to turn.**
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
