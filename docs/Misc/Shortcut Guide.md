Learn how to use keypad and infrared shortcuts to control your devices faster and more efficiently.

### Overview

The BLEShark Nano uses just three physical buttons - Left, Select, and Right - but supports a wide range of input combinations through carefully designed shortcuts.

These shortcuts can be used in the **Remote** app for transmitting infrared signals, as well as in the **Keypad** app to trigger your saved actions with minimal effort.

### Button Reference

- **[L]** - Left
- **[S]** - Select (middle button)
- **[R]** - Right

### Shortcut Combinations

Below are the supported shortcut triggers:

- Press **[L]** once -> Command #1  
- Press **[S]** once -> Command #2  
- Press **[R]** once -> Command #3  
- Double-press **[L]** -> Command #4  
- Double-press **[S]** -> Command #5  
- Double-press **[R]** -> Command #6  
- Hold **[L]** for 300ms -> Command #7  
- Hold **[R]** for 300ms -> Command #8

### Notes on Usage

With the **Remote** app, these shortcuts allow you to transmit infrared commands instantly  ideal for controlling TVs, air conditioners, or other devices on the fly. The speed and simplicity make this system far superior to manually selecting commands one at a time through the **Transmit** app.

And for the **Keypad** app, shortcuts are essential. With only three buttons, the shortcut system unlocks its full potential, giving you precise and flexible control over your configured actions.
