title: Wi-Fi AP Spam
---

Wi-Fi AP Spam allows the BLEShark Nano to create hundreds of fake Wi-Fi networks.  
It’s a fun and flashy way to flood the airwaves with attention-grabbing SSIDs.

### What Is Wi-Fi AP Spam?

This feature works by rapidly broadcasting beacon packets that appear as Wi-Fi networks to nearby devices.  
You can use it to display custom messages, lyrics, or random names - purely for educational or demonstration purposes.

### How to Use

<ul className="step-list">
  <li>Navigate to the **AP Spam** menu from the Wi-Fi menu.</li>
  <li>Select a spam mode:
    Rickrolls, Random, Funny, Targeted (duplicate of a specific network), or Custom Networks.</li>
  <li>To stop the spam, press **[S]** again.</li>
</ul>

### Custom Networks

To broadcast your own list of SSIDs:

<ul className="step-list">
  <li>Create a <code>.csv</code> file with your desired network names, separated by commas:
    <br /><code>network1,network2,network3</code></li>
  <li>Open <strong>Extra Settings Mode</strong> from your BLEShark Nano.</li>
  <li>Connect to the BLEShark Wi-Fi network and access the captive portal.</li>
  <li>Upload your <code>.csv</code> file under the <strong>AP Spam</strong> section.</li>
</ul>

After uploading, just select <strong>Custom Networks</strong> from the app and your SSIDs will appear in the air.


### Available Spam Modes

- **Rickrolls** - Broadcasts lyrics from “Never Gonna Give You Up” as individual SSIDs  
- **Random Networks** - Generates totally random characters per SSID  
- **Funny Networks** - Displays a curated list of funny or weird Wi-Fi names  
- **Duplicate Networks** - Sends the same SSID repeatedly to clutter nearby lists  
- **Custom Networks** - Lets you upload and broadcast your own list of SSIDs

:::caution
Wi-Fi AP spamming should only be used in controlled environments where you have permission.  
Improper use could disrupt nearby devices or violate local regulations.
