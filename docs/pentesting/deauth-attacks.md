title: Deauth Attacks

Deauthentication (Deauth) attacks disconnect devices from a Wi-Fi network by sending false packets. This is intended for ethical Wi-Fi auditing, not public interference.

  <li>Open the <strong>Deauth</strong> app from the Wi-Fi Tools menu.</li>
  <li>The BLEShark will scan for nearby access points and display a list.</li>
  <li>Select a network and press <strong>[S]</strong> to begin the attack.</li>
  <li>The OLED screen will show packet counts and activity.</li>
</ul>

> 5GHz networks are not supported.
