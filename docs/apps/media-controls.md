title: Media Controls
---

The Media Control app lets you wirelessly control music and media playback on paired Bluetooth devices.  
It sends media key commands like play, pause, skip, and volume control through BLE.

This feature is still in development - functionality may vary depending on your device.

### How to Use the Media Control App

<ul className="step-list">
  <li>Open the <strong>Media Control</strong> app from the main menu.</li>
  <li>Make sure your BLEShark Nano is paired with the device you want to control.</li>
  <li>Use <strong>[L]</strong> and <strong>[R]</strong> to scroll through media command options.</li>
  <li>Press <strong>[S]</strong> to send the selected command.</li>
</ul>

### Tips and Notes

- Some devices may require permission to accept media controls over Bluetooth.  
- Volume changes are system-wide. Play/pause and skip commands depend on the active media app.  
- This feature is under development - improvements and expanded support are coming soon.
