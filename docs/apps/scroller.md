title: Scroller
---

The **Scroller App** lets you control your phone semi-hands-free - no touching the screen!  
Scroll, like, and pause videos with just a tap of a button on your BLEShark Nano.  
This is perfect for:
- Eating while watching
- Remote control from across the room
### How to Use

To get started:

<ol className="step-list">
  <li>Navigate to the <strong>Apps</strong> menu on your BLEShark Nano.</li>
  <li>Select <strong>Scroller</strong>.</li>
  <li>On your phone, pair with the BLEShark Nano - the device name is shown on its screen.</li>
</ol>

Here’s how each button works:

| Button         | Action                |
|----------------|------------------------|
| [L] / [R] | Scroll up / down        |
| [S]               | Pause / Unpause         |
| [S] (Double Click) | Like the current video  |

:::caution[Heads-up!]
If you’ve previously paired your BLEShark Nano using the **Bad-BT** app, you may need to **unpair it first**.  
That mode registers the device as a keyboard instead of a mouse, which disables scrolling functions.
