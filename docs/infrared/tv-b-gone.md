**TV-B-Gone** is a universal IR feature that sends power-off signals for hundreds of TV brands.  
It cycles through each code automatically until it finds one that works, making it effective in places like stores, restaurants, and waiting rooms.

### How to Use TV-B-Gone

<ul className="step-list">
  <li>Navigate to <strong>IR Tools</strong> from the main menu.</li>
  <li>Select <strong>TV-B-Gone</strong> and press the confirm button.</li>
  <li>Point the BLEShark Nano at the target TV.</li>
  <li>Wait while the device cycles through power-off commands.</li>
  <li>The screen will turn off once the correct signal is sent - no further input needed.</li>
</ul>

### Tips for Best Results

- Use **Extra Settings Mode** to switch between US and EU IR code sets.  
- Keep the BLEShark Nano pointed directly at the TV’s IR receiver.  
- Some TVs may take longer to respond — the Nano is cycling through many brand codes.
