The **Transmit** app lets you send recorded infrared (IR) commands from your BLEShark Nano to control TVs, AC units, projectors, and more.

If you prefer shortcut-based control, check out the [IR Remote App](https://github.com/grdashark/BLEShark/wiki/%F0%9F%9A%A6-IR-Remote).

### How to Use the Transmit App

<ul className="step-list">
  <li>Open the <strong>Transmit</strong> app from the main menu.</li>
  <li>Select the remote you want to use.</li>
  <li>Aim the BLEShark Nano directly at the target device.</li>
  <li>Use <strong>[L]</strong> and <strong>[R]</strong> to navigate through saved commands.</li>
  <li>Press <strong>[S]</strong> to transmit the selected command.</li>
</ul>

### Tips for Best Results

- Aim the BLEShark Nano directly at the target device’s IR sensor.  
- Make sure you’ve already saved commands using the **Receive** app.  
- IR signals work best indoors. Avoid strong light, sunlight, or reflective surfaces.
