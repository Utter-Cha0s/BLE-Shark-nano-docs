The Deauth Checker app helps detect Wi-Fi deauthentication attacks in real time. It’s useful for spotting disruption attempts!

### What Is a Deauth Attack?

A deauthentication attack disconnects devices from a Wi-Fi network by sending fake disconnect packets.  
It’s commonly used in Wi-Fi hacking or stress testing environments.

### What Does the Deauth Checker Do?

This app continuously scans all 2.4GHz Wi-Fi channels and listens for patterns that match known deauth attack signatures.  
If an attack is detected, you’ll see an alert on the OLED screen.

### How to Use

<ul className="step-list">
  <li>Open the <strong>Deauth Checker</strong> app from the Wi-Fi Tools menu.</li>
  <li>The OLED screen will show which channel is currently being scanned.</li>
  <li>If a deauth attack is detected, a notification will appear instantly.</li>
</ul>

### Use Cases

- Monitoring your network for interference or attack attempts  
- Demonstrating or logging deauth behavior during pentesting  
- Identifying if network instability is due to active interference
