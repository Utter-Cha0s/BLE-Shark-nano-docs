The Evil Portal lets mimics public login screens and captures user inputs locally - but with built-in protections. Perfect for use in security demos and phishing simulations.  
### What Is an Evil Portal?

An Evil Portal is a malicious or deceptive captive portal designed to mimic legitimate login pages. Typically, captive portals are used in public spaces like cafes, hotels, and airports, requiring users to interact with them before gaining internet access. The BLEShark Nano lets you create a phishing captive portal (or Evil Portal) that tricks users into entering their credentials.

### How to Use

<ul className="step-list">
  <li>Open the <strong>Evil Portal</strong> app from the Wi-Fi Tools menu.</li>
  <li>The BLEShark Nano will start up it's own Evil AP.</li>
  <li>When a target connects, the portal will pop up automatically.</li>
</ul>

### Important Limitations

- Submitted credentials are never stored
