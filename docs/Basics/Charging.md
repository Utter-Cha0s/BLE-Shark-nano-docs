Charging the BLEShark Nano is simple, but there are a few things to know to make sure it works as expected.

### Basic Charging Steps

<ul className="step-list">
  <li>Set the side switch to <strong>ON</strong> before plugging in. The device will not charge if it's OFF.</li>
  <li>Connect a USB-C cable to the port on the BLEShark Nano.</li>
  <li>Look for the red LED indicator next to the USB port to confirm charging.</li>
</ul>

### What the Red LED Means

- <strong>Solid Red</strong> - Charging is active.  
- <strong>No Light (while plugged in, switch ON)</strong> - Charging is complete.  
- <strong>Dim or Flickering</strong> - Most likely, the switch is not flipped to ON. If it is, check for a loose cable or weak power source.
