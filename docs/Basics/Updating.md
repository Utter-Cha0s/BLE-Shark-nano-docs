Firmware updates improve performance, fix bugs, and add new features to your BLEShark Nano.  
Keeping your device updated ensures you're always running the latest enhancements.

Your BLEShark Nano checks for updates every time it boots (as long as it's connected to Wi-Fi).  
It compares the installed version to the latest version hosted on GitHub.  
This check is quick - usually takes about <strong>1-5 seconds</strong>.

Automatic updates are <strong>enabled by default</strong>, but you can turn them off via <strong>Extra Settings Mode</strong>.

### How Auto Updates Work

<ul className="step-list">
  <li>On boot, if an update is available, you’ll see: <em>“Do you want to update?”</em></li>
  <li>Use <strong>[L]</strong> and <strong>[R]</strong> to toggle your choice.</li>
  <li>Press <strong>[S]</strong> to confirm and start the update.</li>
</ul>

### What Happens During an Update

  <li>The latest firmware is downloaded from the official repo.</li>
  <li>It installs automatically - no user input needed.</li>
  <li>Total time: usually <strong>1–2 minutes</strong>.</li>
</ul>

Once it's done, you’ll have the newest features, fixes, and improvements - no cables, no hassle.
